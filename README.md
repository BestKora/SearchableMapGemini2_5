 I teamed up with Google's brilliant AI, Gemini 2.5 Pro Experimental, to create an app that works like this:
 
* You type a city/place name in the text box at the bottom of the screen.
* With each new letter you type, a list of search suggestions is generated below.
* Press Enter in the search bar and the map shows the found places.
* Select a marker - a Look Around panorama opens at the bottom (if available).
* Clicking on different markers gives us different LookAroundPreviews at the bottom.
* Clicking anywhere on the map outside of LookAroundPreview brings back the search bar with the list of suggestions and starts searching again.
* You can also select the location you need directly from the list of suggestions, in which case a LookAroundPreview also appears at the bottom.
